When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When i am working on some other computer or i have contributers to my project/code in that case I would want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all work local.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

some of the files i may not want to pull to my computer as they will
only consume memory and will not be of much use to me i will only pull 
files to which i have made significant changes or it is helpfull in
my completion of current project that i am working right now.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks will be visible to the one person from whom we have forked the project that is like we are telling the person that i two will be working on this project and so this project will be visible on my homepage also.
cloning in the other way extracts the projects doirectly from the person
and it will not be visible on our homepage untill we add it.otherwise same as forking
branching helps us differentiate betwwn our real work and experimental work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

with this we can keep our file up to date by merging and be sure to keep that 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

i think it would be harder as the code length incereases as it would take a lot of time to merge files /code.

Hmmm... just trying branch push sry for inconvinience :-)
